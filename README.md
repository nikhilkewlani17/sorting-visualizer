# sorting-visualizer
A sorting visualizer is an interactive tool or application designed to help users understand and visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Sorting algorithms are fundamental techniques used in computer science to rearrange elements in a list or an array in a specific order, such as ascending or descending.

The sorting visualizer provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step. It allows users to observe how the algorithms manipulate the elements to achieve the desired sorted arrangement. The visualizer typically displays the elements as bars, circles, or other shapes, where each element's size or position represents its value in the list.
